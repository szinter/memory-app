# Memory

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Description

Your task is to build a simple card-matching game, the kind that your brother/sister/best friend always cheated at when you were little. In case you need a reminder, here’s how it should work:

- Present the user with an even number of cards, “face down”.

- When the user clicks a card, “flip it over” and reveal the hidden image.

- When two cards are revealed:

    - If the cards are identical, remove them from play.

    - If they are not, flip them back.

- The game ends when all cards are removed.

To get full points, your app should also fulfil all of the below requirements:

- It should be responsive.

- It should have a landing page for the app that explains the rules, and a separate screen for the actual game.

- We expect a SPA.

- Allow the user to play more than one game without reloading the page.

- Allow the user to set the number of cards before a new game (min. 3, max. 10 pairs).

- Present the user with a score counter that increments after every second card flip.

- Allow the user to continue the previously played game after reloading the page.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
